# Asteroid Dodge!

## Introduction
After many endless nights, you finally have a working JavaScript spaceship! And now you take flight but watch out! Asteroids ahead!!!

**Asteroid Dodge** uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate a web game where you control a Spaceship as it navigates falling meteors. Be careful, your spaceship can only withstand few impacts (3 to be exact)!

### Features
- Designed entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Customizable game length
  - See ***game parameters*** section of **index.js**
  
```
let startTime = 10; /* secs per level */
let livesTotal = 100; /* number of crashes allowed */
let startLevel = 0; /* starting level */
let endLevel = 10; /* ending level */
```
